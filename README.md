The challenge involves creating an Encryption Application capable of encrypting and decrypting text using a chosen encryption algorithm. Users should be able to input text, select an encryption method, and then encrypt or decrypt the text accordingly. Common encryption algorithms like Caesar Cipher or ROT13 can be implemented.
